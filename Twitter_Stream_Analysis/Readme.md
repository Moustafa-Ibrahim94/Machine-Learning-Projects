# Twitter Stream Analysis Project

## Twitter Stream Analysis
Twitter Stream Analysis is a Python web application that performs sentiment analysis on tweets retrieved from Twitter using the Tweepy library and the TextBlob package. The application allows users to enter a query and retrieve up to 25 tweets matching the query. It then applies sentiment analysis on each tweet to determine whether it is positive, negative, or neutral, and calculates the percentage of positive, negative, and neutral tweets.

## Getting Started
