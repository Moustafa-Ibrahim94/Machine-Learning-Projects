# Crop Selection Optimization with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

In the realm of modern agriculture, optimizing crop selection is crucial for farmers. This project, merging agriculture and machine learning, aims to assist farmers in making informed decisions about crop selection based on essential soil metrics.

## Background

Farmers, constrained by budget, often measure only a limited number of soil properties to determine the most suitable crop for their land. The key soil measures include Nitrogen (N) Content Ratio, Phosphorous (P) Content Ratio, Potassium (K) Content Ratio, and pH Value. These measures are vital for plant growth, root development, overall plant health, and soil acidity or alkalinity.

## The Problem

The challenge is to identify the most critical soil properties (two out of four) that influence crop selection, enabling farmers to make cost-effective and efficient decisions.

## Objectives

1. **Feature Selection:** Determine the two most influential soil properties for crop prediction.
2. **Model Building:** Develop a multi-class classification model to predict the optimal crop based on the selected soil properties.
3. **Avoiding Multicollinearity:** Ensure selected features are not highly correlated to improve model accuracy.

## Dataset Description

The `soil_measures.csv` dataset contains Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K) content ratios, soil pH value, and crop types.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Explore missing values, data types, and distribution of crop types.
2. **Feature Analysis and Selection:** Use statistical methods and machine learning techniques.
3. **Model Development:** Implement an effective classification model, likely XGBoost.
4. **Evaluation:** Assess the model's performance using metrics, focusing on achieving a high F1 score.
5. **Handling Multicollinearity:** Examine feature correlation to avoid redundancy.

## Anticipated Challenges

1. **Feature Selection:** Balancing predictive power and simplicity.
2. **Model Complexity:** Balancing model complexity with limited features.

## Expected Outcome

A reliable model guiding farmers in choosing the most suitable crop based on limited soil measurements, potentially leading to better crop yields and economic benefits.

## Conclusion

This project goes beyond building a machine learning model; it's about aiding farmers in making data-driven decisions, showcasing the practical and impactful application of AI in agriculture.
